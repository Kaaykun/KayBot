### <div align='center'> Multipurpose ChatBot created using Python, capable of helping with daily tasks </div>

#### KayBot is an ongoing project aimed at developing a chatbot using TensorFlow Keras. The goal is to create a versatile and intelligent conversational agent that can be used for various applications:  
- **Chat with the user.**   
Example promts: *'Who made you?', 'Tell me a joke', 'Ask me a riddle'*  
- **List all available commands.**    
Example prompts: *'What can you do?' or 'help'*  
- **Perform google searches and open new tabs with the results.**    
Example prompts: *'google: GitHub'*
- **Tell the current date and time.**    
Example prompts: *'Whats the time?', 'date', 'What day is today'*
- **Inform about the weather in any city.**    
Example prompts: *'weather: Tokyo', 'weather: Chicago'*
- **Link to articles of the latest news.**    
Example prompts: *'latest news', 'news'*
- **List the top 10 trending songs on the global charts.**    
Example prompts: *'top songs', 'hot songs', 'songs'*
- *[Currently bugged and under investigation]* **Keep track of a set timer (in minutes) and ring and alarm when the time is up.**   
Example prompts: *'timer: 1', 'timer: 10'*
